        MAKE TEST
----------------------------------------

To run all the test cases type 

     $ cd check/
     $ ./check_SMI_cases

on your command line. If test case was running properly, i.e. is 
consistent with the pre-defined output, command line output will be 

     $ case #[id] o.k. 

otherwise, if the test scenario failed either during runtime or 
because of inconsistent output 

     $ case #[id] failed

will be written on standard output. Additionally, you will find a file
standard.output in each specific test case folder case_[id]/ containing the 
SMI print-outs. Inspecting this file might help you to find the reason 
of failure. You can use 'check_SMI_cases clean' to clean up the case
directories.
Only if all test cases pass the make test, you can use the EDgE
modelling chain

Please be aware that the test cases only include switches specified 
within a namelist. This means that you should run "./check_SMI_cases" with 
the Makefile setting for

    (1a) compiler = gnu
    (1b) compiler = nag
    (1c) compiler = intel
    (2a) openmp   = true
    (2b) openmp   = false

----------------------------------------
        TEST CASES
----------------------------------------

case 1 :: calculate SMI for SM

case 2 :: Read kernel from previously calculated SMI file

case 3 :: Read kernel and data for one dataset and apply it to another

case 4 :: calculate daily SMI for a portion of the year

case 5 :: invert daily SMI of case 4

case 6 :: cluster calculation for SMI values calculated in case 1
